Dec 20: Need to fix get playlist URIs and
then test calculate audio features, also
need to add some sort of minimum value for comparison.

Fixed the playlist URIs, got the average audio features.
Still need to add comparison feature for minimum ratio check.
Also need to find a way to add a genre, artist, or track seed
when I don't want to (like in large playlists.)

June 13: Added a random sample of the URIs that will take place instead of 
the first 5 songs. Removed the limit of songs that can be generated.
I think the next steps have to be:
- user authorization handling so others can use it.
- front end development.
- revamping backend so it can communicate with frontend.
